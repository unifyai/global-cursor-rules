description: Fixing Failing Tests with Temporary Debug Logging
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: true

This rule standardizes how we add temporary debug logging during failing tests and how we clean it up afterwards. ALWAYS use this process in Cursor chats WHENEVER A TEST FAILS. This is the ONLY permitted way to address failing tests.

1) Always start with hardcoded, unconditional debug logs
- Add logs immediately, without flags or guards. Do not gate behind environment variables or configuration.
- Use a dedicated function (e.g. `CURSOR_DEBUG_LOG`) or a standard logging statement with a distinctive prefix (e.g. `console.log('[CURSOR_DEBUG]', ...)`).
- **Finding the function**: If your project has a shared debug utility, search for it (e.g. `rg "CURSOR_DEBUG_LOG"`) and import from there. Otherwise, use a grep-friendly prefix directly.
- Behavior: Prints a one-line entry to stderr/stdout with timestamp and caller location (where possible), making it easy to correlate with test runs.

2) Investigation workflow
- Step A: Add targeted debug calls around suspected code paths.
- Step B: Re-run the failing test(s) and inspect the new logs.
- Step C: If you are not 100% certain of the root cause, add more debug entries and repeat.
- Step D: Only when you are 100% confident of the cause, implement a direct fix (with or without keeping some logs briefly for confirmation).
- Step E: The user may repeatedly re-run tests and paste logs; continue iterating until the issue is definitively fixed.

3) Cleanup policy
- After the fix is confirmed, remove all temporary logging.
- Grep to find every occurrence:
  - ripgrep: `rg -n "CURSOR_DEBUG_LOG" -S`
  - grep:    `grep -Rin "CURSOR_DEBUG_LOG" .`
- Delete each call site (and any now-unused imports) before finalizing the fix.

4) Alignment with workspace rules
- No fast paths or heuristics: Logging should not add conditional shortcuts; it merely reports state unconditionally.
- No exception-handling shields: Do not add defensive exception handling (try/catch, try/except) around the logs. Keep failures visible.
- No test details in production prompts: Temporary logs must not leak test-specific information into production prompts or docstrings.
- Rapid evolution: This logging is temporary by design; remove it once the issue is resolved—do not preserve backward compatibility.

5) Intent and scope
- This logging exists solely for interactive debugging in Cursor chats.
- The unique function name is intentionally grep-friendly to ensure quick cleanup on request.
