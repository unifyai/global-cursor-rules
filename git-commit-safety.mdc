# Git Commit Safety

## Context
When multiple agents run in parallel in `local` mode, there is a race condition risk if they use the shared git index (staging area).
- Agent A: `git add fileA`
- Agent B: `git add fileB`
- Agent A: `git commit -m "msg"` -> Commits BOTH fileA and fileB!

## Rule: Explicit Path Commits
To eliminate this risk, **NEVER** run `git commit` without explicit file arguments.

### Incorrect
```bash
git add file1.py
git commit -m "Update file1"
```

### Correct
```bash
# For modified files:
git commit file1.py -m "Update file1"

# For new (untracked) files:
git add file1.py
git commit file1.py -m "Add file1"
```

### Reasoning
Passing filenames to `git commit` bypasses the shared index for that specific commit operation, ensuring that Agent A only commits what it intends to, regardless of what Agent B has staged.
