description: No Test Info in Production Code

If a test is failing, we should **never** add test-specific information or shortcuts to production code as a hack to get the test passing. No details about specific test cases should ever make their way into production code—no special-case branches, no hardcoded values that match test inputs, no conditional logic that only exists to satisfy a test.

All fixes must be fully general and **much** broader than the specific failing test. We do **not** want to overfit production code to a specific set of tests.
